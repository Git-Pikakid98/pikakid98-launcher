# Pikakid98 Launcher
My very own launcher for all of the stuff on my Github. It's currently very barebones and the basic functionality is all that exists.. However, This launcher unlike my other launchers actually comes with an auto updater.. emphasis on "auto".. I still have to manually upload the files that it downloads

<h1>Building Requirements</h1>

[Game Maker 8.1](https://archive.org/details/GameMaker81)

[HTTP Downloader](https://github.com/erickutcher/httpdownloader/releases)

[7-Zip (Command Line)](https://www.7-zip.org/)

<h1>Extra</h1>
I'm currently working on a simple auto updater.. But that's easier said that done.. It's extremely tedious.. So for now you'll have to manually update the launcher yourself.. Sorry
