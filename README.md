# Pikakid98 Launcher
My very own launcher for all of the stuff on my Github. It's currently very barebones and the basic functionality is all that exists.. However, This launcher unlike my other launchers actually comes with an auto updater.. emphasis on "auto".. I still have to manually upload the files that it downloads

# Planned Featured

• Artwork per repository
\
• A description for each repository menu
\
• A logo (if possible) for every repository
\
• A menu popup for things like dev builds and an option to patch Game Maker Legacy games with gm8x_fix


# Bug Tracker

• Clicking the “Play” button currently has no cooldown (This can possibly cause system slowdown if clicked too many times)
\
• Opening multiple download scripts MAY cause problems (though this hasn’t been verified.. Just don’t do it)
